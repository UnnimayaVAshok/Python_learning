# Python Learning Journey 🐍

This repository contains my Python practice programs as I build strong fundamentals in Python.

## 📌 Day 1 – String Formatting & Basics

Topics Covered:
- Printing output
- Variables
- String concatenation
- format() method
- f-strings
- Taking user input
- String methods (capitalize, lower)

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Different ways to print strings
- Formatting strings using:
  - Concatenation
  - format()
  - f-strings
- Converting text to uppercase and lowercase

## 🚀 Goal

To improve my Python fundamentals and consistently practice coding while learning Git and GitHub.

📌 Day 2 – Numbers & Exception Handling

Topics Covered:

Taking numeric input
Type conversion using int()
Performing arithmetic operations
Understanding common errors

Handling exceptions using:
try
except
finally

Working with date and time using the datetime module:
Performing date calculations using timedelta
Parsing user-input dates using strptime()

Extracting:
Day
Month
Year

🧠 What I Practiced
