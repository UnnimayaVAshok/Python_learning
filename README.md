# Python Learning Journey 🐍

This repository contains my Python practice programs as I build strong fundamentals in Python.

## 📌 Day 1 – String Formatting & Basics

Topics Covered:
- Printing output
- Variables
- String concatenation
- format() method
- f-strings
- Taking user input
- String methods (capitalize, lower)

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Different ways to print strings
- Formatting strings using:
  - Concatenation
  - format()
  - f-strings
- Converting text to uppercase and lowercase

## 🚀 Goal

To improve my Python fundamentals and consistently practice coding while learning Git and GitHub.

📌 Day 2 – Numbers & Exception Handling

Topics Covered:

Taking numeric input
Type conversion using int()
Performing arithmetic operations
Understanding common errors

Handling exceptions using:
try
except
finally

Working with date and time using the datetime module:
Performing date calculations using timedelta
Parsing user-input dates using strptime()

Extracting:
Day
Month
Year

🧠 What I Practiced

Converting string input to integer
Handling ZeroDivisionError
Getting current date and time using datetime.now()

Calculating:
Yesterday’s date
Last week’s date
Taking birthday input in dd/mm/yyyy format

Extracting individual date components using:
.day
.month
.year

📌 Day 3 – Conditional Statements & Decision Making
🧠 Topics Covered
Basic if-else statements
Using elif for multiple conditions
Nested if statements
Membership operator (in)
Logical operators:
and
or
Case-insensitive comparison using .lower()

💻 What I Practiced
Voting eligibility check based on age
Grade classification system using marks
Degree eligibility verification using nested conditions
Using tuple membership to simplify multiple comparisons
Combining conditions using logical operators

🚀 Learning Outcome
Through Day 3 practice, I learned:
How decision-making works in Python
How Python evaluates multiple conditions

Concepts Practiced:
List operations (adding, reversing, searching, removing elements)
Understanding that lists are mutable and heterogeneous
Working with arrays and understanding homogeneous data storage
Performing basic array operations
Creating and updating dictionaries
Accessing dictionary values using key-based methods
Key Learning:
Difference between list and array
Mutable data structures
Key-value pair storage in dictionaries

2️⃣ function.py
Concepts Practiced:
Function without parameters
Function with parameters
Function with default (optional) parameter
Returning values from functions
Type conversion inside functions
Key Learning:
How functions improve code reusability
Parameter passing
Default arguments

3️⃣ loop.py
Concepts Practiced:
For loop with range
While loop with condition
Incrementing variables inside loops
Key Learning:
Iteration control
Loop execution flow
Condition-based repetition

🎯 Learning Outcome
Stronger understanding of Python collections
Clear difference between mutable and homogeneous data types
